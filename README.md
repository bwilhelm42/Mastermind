# Mastermind
Just starting to learn Java. Decided creating Mastermind would give me a good intro to the language.

# Usage

Compile with "javac Main.java"

Run with "java Main [-a attempts][-c code]"

# Rules
The goal of the game is to guess a secret code.

You are given a certain number of guesses (10 by default).

A valid code consists of 4 distinct pieces represented by numbers 1 - 7.

Upon guessing, you will be presented with a report consisting of two numbers:
1) Pieces that were correctly placed
2) Pieces that were incorrectly placed

Use logic in your guesses to find the answer!
